# Aries_project

This project generates smooth visual transitions between two text prompts. Utilized the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model for high-quality image synthesis and LLaMA 3.3-70B Versatile for enriching input prompts with detailed descriptions. The system takes two user-provided texts, enhances them with contextual detail via the LLM, and produces a GIF illustrating a seamless transformation from the first object to the second. Integrated gradio to develop an interactive and user-friendly frontend.
